            Social media stands out as one of the most effective platforms for
            boosting business growth and increasing brand recognition. Building
            a presence and networking on social channels is essential for any
            new business—90% of marketers report that even a few hours spent on
            social media can significantly enhance brand visibility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-900">
            Beyond visibility, social media helps you truly understand your
            customers. By engaging with your audience and observing their posts
            and interests, you gain valuable insights into what they want and
            need. This knowledge allows you to share content that resonates,
            attract more visitors, and foster stronger relationships with your
            customers.
